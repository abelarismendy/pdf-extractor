# PDF Extractor

This script is a tool that allows you to extract PDF files from books on the Universidad de los Andes platform (http://www.ebooks7-24.com.ezproxy.uniandes.edu.co/). It uses the Selenium library for web scraping to access the content of the books and generate the PDF files.


## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Selenium library
- Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver

## Setup

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download and install the Chrome browser.
4. Download the appropriate version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for your system and place it in the `drivers` folder.
5. Update the `chrome_path` variable in the script with the path to the ChromeDriver executable.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing `python3 main.py` in the terminal.
2. A dialog window will prompt you to enter the book id (4 digits). Enter the book id (which you can find in the 'URL del ebook' field on the book page - it is the last 4 digits of the URL) and click OK.
3. The script will open the Chrome browser and navigate to the login page for the Universidad de los Andes platform.
4. If you are already logged in to the platform, the script will proceed to the book page. If you are not logged in, you will need to complete the login form and the 2-step verification process before the script can proceed.
5. The script will prompt you to enter the first page and the last page of the book that you want to extract. Enter the page numbers and click OK.
6. Once the script has access to the book page, it will start extracting the PDF files and saving them to the `pdf` folder in the script's directory.
7. After all pages were processed, the script will merge all the single page PDFs into a single PDF file located in the `books` folder. The name of the file is the book code.
